			Hood Samaritan!<br> <br>
		</h1>
		<h3>Hood Samaritan is a connection hub for those wanting to
			devote their time and skills to others within their community who
			have needs to be filled. The goal is to promote community altruism
			and engagement.</h3>

		<h5>Have you ever needed some help around the house or with a
			project, but didn't have the resources to hire a professional
			company? Have you ever saw needs in your neighborhood that you just
			knew you had the skills to fill but didn't know how to start? Hood
			Samaritan is looking to bridge that gap between the community and the
			individual. There is no catch, no fine print, and no gimmicks. To
			further the altruistic nature of the program, you now have the
			ability to donate to hundreds of 501(3) charities as a way to
			pay-it-forward after a member donates their time to helping you with
			a project.</h5>

			<p>Hood Samaritan is a connection hub for those wanting to devote
				their time and skills to others within their community who have
				needs to be filled. The goal is to promote community altruism and
				engagement.</p>

			<p>Have you ever needed some help around the house or with a
				project, but didn't have the resources to hire a professional
				company? Have you ever seen needs in your neighborhood that you just
				knew you had the skills to fill but didn't know how to start? Hood
				Samaritan is looking to bridge that gap between the community and
				the individual. There is no catch, no fine print, and no gimmicks.
				To further the altruistic nature of the program, you now have the
				ability to donate to hundreds of 501(3) charities as a way to
				pay-it-forward after a member donates their time to helping you with
				a project.</p>
